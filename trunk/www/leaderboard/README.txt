Leaderboard info
============================

This is a simple leaderboard PHP app.  You will need SQLite for PHP installed.
Also to package up your event session you should run 'preparefiles.rb' first.
This will compress the image files and zip them up to be transfered to a web
server.  You'll need rmajick and rubyzip for that.

This is basically just a PoC at the moment.  I plan on making this much
nicer as new versions of DrinkDuino become available.
